## 🗄️ Database

### Schema

**5 SQLite Tables** with foreign key relationships:

1. **employees**: Employee data
   - Fields: external_id, first_name, last_name, email, phone, status, workspace, role, contract_type, entry_date
   - Indexes: external_id (unique), status, workspace, role, contract_type

2. **caces**: Safety certifications
   - Relation: employee_id → employees.id (CASCADE DELETE)
   - Fields: kind, completion_date, expiration_date, document_path
   - Index: (employee_id, expiration_date)

3. **medical_visits**: Medical visits
   - Relation: employee_id → employees.id (CASCADE DELETE)
   - Fields: visit_type, visit_date, expiration_date, result, document_path
   - Index: (employee_id, expiration_date)

4. **online_trainings**: Online training
   - Relation: employee_id → employees.id (CASCADE DELETE)
   - Fields: title, completion_date, validity_months, expiration_date, certificate_path
   - Index: (employee_id, expiration_date)

5. **app_locks**: Concurrent access locks
   - Fields: hostname, username, locked_at, last_heartbeat, process_id
   - Indexes: hostname, locked_at, last_heartbeat

### Location

**Default**: `data/employee_manager.db`

**Customizable** via environment variables.

### Concurrency

- **WAL mode** (Write-Ahead Logging) for concurrent reads
- **PRAGMA foreign_keys = 1** for referential integrity
- **CASCADE DELETE**: Deleting an employee deletes all related data
